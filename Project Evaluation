 These levels often map to terms like:

High: Critical features, urgent bug fixes, or essential functionalities impacting core system operation. 
These must be addressed immediately.

Medium: Important features, minor bugs, or improvements that enhance user experience but aren't critical to system functionality. 
These should be addressed within a reasonable timeframe.

Low: Features that are nice-to-haves, minor cosmetic changes, or improvements that can be postponed without significant impact. 
These are usually addressed after higher-priority tasks.
